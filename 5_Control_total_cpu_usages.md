In this file we will see how to limit total CPU usages of a user.

** By using cpulimit and cputool command we can control only the CPU usages of any process. But by this way we cannot restrict
user's overall CPU uses. For example if we apply restriction on one process of a user then user can start another process which
will may consume 100% CPU of our system. **
